# savings-calculator
A customizable savings calculator for marketing purposes. Built with React.

Marketers will be able to preload the calculator with custom values for their rates/fees/prices and then ask prospects to enter their current pricing values. The calculator then indicates whether and how much can be saved.

I may also be interested in adding a machine learning API that can read a customer's submitted .pdf and pull values directly from that.
